# Mission

Our mission is to evolve the world’s data, embracing new standards of security and economics. That doesn’t mean rebuilding everything from scratch, we believe that the path to the future involves Weaving existing technology into the patterns that are commonly known as Web3.

Our view is Web3 data has the following features:

- **Security**: Faking identities or tampering with data should be nearly impossible through the use of cryptographic guarantees that are hardened through the signed activity of trust network members.
- **Lineage**: Every interaction with data should be tracked to give confidence that data isn’t being leaked or used inappropriately.
- **Privacy**: Confidential Computing should be used as often as possible to minimize both the leaking of sensitive information as well as the unnecessary copying of data.
- **Economics**: Data flows should have a cost associated with them, to make it easy to compensate sources of data directly instead of through weak promises.
- **Interoperability**: Data should conform to standards and be made available to authorized parties programmatically, both via Web2 APIs and Web3 Oracles.

We built Weavechain because it was impossible to give data these features in a way that was easy or compliant. Storing even encrypted data on Public Web3 solutions like IPFS, Arweave, or natively in a smart contract on Ethereum or Solana is neither GDPR nor HIPAA compliant. To be GDPR compliant means that you have to satisfy an erasure obligation commonly known as “the right to be forgotten”, and you can’t delete data from Public Web3 by design. To be HIPAA requires a “physical safeguard” like a firewall, a “technical safeguard” like encryption isn’t sufficient. And rebuilding applications using Private Web3 solutions like Hyperledger is rip and replace on steroids, dramatically more difficult than what’s feasible for most.

Weavechain changes this pattern by attaching to databases, dynamically creating blockchain anchors for security, and acting as an API gateway to manage economics. By making it easy, our hope is that we can minimize the barriers to establishing Web3 data and push its adoption. Our children will look back on data transfers that lack the above features as barbaric, wondering why we allowed such critical activity to happen in such a loose fashion. We believe that Web3 data will become as pervasive as the HTTPS lock icon in your browser, a passive part of all of our lives that is flat out a better way of doing things.
