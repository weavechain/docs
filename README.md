[https://weavechain.com](https://weavechain.com): Layer-0 For Data

Weavechain's mission is to evolve the world’s data, embracing new standards of security and economics. That doesn’t mean rebuilding everything from scratch, we believe that the path to the future involves Weaving existing technology into the patterns that are commonly known as Web3.

Web3 data has the following features:

- **Security**: Faking identities or tampering with data should be nearly impossible through the use of cryptographic guarantees that are hardened through the signed activity of trust network members.
- **Lineage**: Every interaction with data should be tracked to give confidence that data isn’t being leaked or used inappropriately.
- **Privacy**: Confidential Computing should be used as often as possible to minimize both the leaking of sensitive information as well as the unnecessary copying of data.
- **Economics**: Data flows should have a cost associated with them, to make it easy to compensate sources of data directly instead of through weak promises.
- **Interoperability**: Data should conform to standards and be made available to authorized parties programmatically, both via Web2 APIs and Web3 Oracles.
